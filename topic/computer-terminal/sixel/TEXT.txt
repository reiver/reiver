§ Sixel

The sixel graphics data‐format is a data‐format used by a number computer‐terminals to do things such as:

• drawing images on a computer‐terminal display screen, and
• load a soft-character-set into a computer‐terminal's dynamically-redefined-character-set (DRCS) memory.

The word sixel is short for “six pixels” — a reference to the way the sixel data‐format encodes a bitmap image.

§§ Computer Terminals

Some computer‐terminals, whose support for sixel graphics included being able to draw sixel images to the display screen, include:

• VT240,
• VT241,
• VT330, and
• VT340.

§§ Sixel Data Format

A sixel image is sent in‐band to a computer‐terminal using escape‐sequence style control‐codes.

The beginning of a sixel image's data is marked by the usual DEC device‐control‐string (DCS) of:

	␛P

Or in decimal:

	27 80

Or in hexadecimal:

	0x1B 0x50

Or in binary:

	0b00011011 0b01010000
