An ansimation is an animation created using (some type of) text characters and ANSI‐escape‐codes.

The ANSI‐escape‐codes are typically used for:

• moving the text cursor,
• clearing all or some part of the line,
• clearing all or some part of the screen,
• setting the background color of a character,
• setting the foreground color of a character.

Ansimations are designed to run on computer-terminals or terminal-emulators that support ANSI‐escape‐codes.

An ansimation animation's frame-rate  depend on the inherent baud-rates of the computer-terminal. The faster the baud-rate, the faster the frame-rate of the ansimation animation. The slower the baud-rate, the slower the frame-rate of the ansimation animation.
