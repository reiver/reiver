§ Semigraphics

Semigraphics are graphics created using typographical‐glyphs from a character‐set that has special characters for that purpose.

Many of the different types of historic semigraphics have been added to unicode. Some examples of these include:

• unicode block‐elements,
• unicode box‐drawing‐characters, and
• unicode geometric‐shapes.

Related to semigraphics are:

• ansi‐art,
• ansimations,
• ascii‐art,
• mouse‐text.
